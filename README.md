# decimal_representation

## Examples:

* If the input provided is: “236”, then your solution should return &quot;632,623,362,326,263,236&quot;
as these are all the combination that can be made with integers that the string contains
* If the input provided is: “A 3B2 C6D”, then your solution should return

&quot;632,623,362,326,263,236&quot; as well, but this time notice that the provided string had non-
integers characters and whitespaces, so an extraction of integers was first made to
obtain the correct solution

* If the input provided does not contain any integers: “ABC”, then your solution should
return the appropriate error exception message.
